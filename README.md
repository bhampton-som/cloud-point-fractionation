# Cloud point fractionation of proteins for bottom-up proteomics.
*Triton X114 extraction allows fast and efficient fractionation into nuclear, cytosolic and membrane fractions*
>This workflow was inspired by the work of Kyle Brown *et. al. Anal. Chem. 2020, 92, 24, 15726–15735* - ["Top-Down Proteomics of Endogenous Membrane Proteins Enabled by Cloud Point Enrichment and Multidimensional Liquid Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry"](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c02533). 

Although the paper focuses on top-down proteomics of membrane proteins, cloud point extraction is useful for subcellular fractionation. The resulting protein fractions are easily applied to bottom-up proteomics workflows.  In this case the membrane fraction is defined by those proteins that partition into the detergent phase after cloud formation that occurs above ~22°C. Conversely the cytosolic fraction is defined by those proteins that parition into the mostly aqueous phase, while the nuclear fraction is defined by the material that is pelleted by the first high speed spin at 4°C before inducing clouding.  Triton X114 doesn't lyse nuclei.
