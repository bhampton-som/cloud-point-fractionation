# Cloud point fractionation of proteins for bottom-up proteomics analysis
*Triton X114 extraction allows fast and efficient fractionation into nuclear, cytosolic and membrane fractions*
>This workflow was inspired by the work of Kyle Brown *et. al. Anal. Chem. 2020, 92, 24, 15726–15735* - ["Top-Down Proteomics of Endogenous Membrane Proteins Enabled by Cloud Point Enrichment and Multidimensional Liquid Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry"](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c02533). 
>Although the paper focuses on top-down proteomics of membrane proteins, cloud point extraction is highly useful for subcellular fractionation.
